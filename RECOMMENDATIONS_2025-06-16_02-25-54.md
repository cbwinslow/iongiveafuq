Initial recommendations will be added after analyzing site requirements.
- [x] Implement comprehensive frontend routing with React Router.
- [x] Create placeholder pages (Home, Store, About, Mascots, Cart) to visualize structure early.
- [x] Add CI task to run `npm run build` for both frontend and backend once dependencies are installed.
- [ ] Consider moving `public/index.html` to project root so Vite can build without extra configuration.
- [x] Add README with setup instructions and contributor guidelines.
