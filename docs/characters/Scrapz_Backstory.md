# Scrapz the Cat - Extended Backstory

*Born in the neon-soaked alleyways of Yokohama,* Scrapz clawed his way up from a runt in a feral litter to the undisputed king of trashcans. His torn ear is a souvenir from a turf war with a rival cat gang, and the ever-present cigarette is his badge of rebellion. Despite his lazy demeanor, Scrapz secretly nurtures a passion for underground jazz and plays a mean saxophone when no one's watching.
