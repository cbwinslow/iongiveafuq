**Location:** The Roach Motel  
**Time:** afternoon  
**Mood:** barely contained rage  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when their addiction/vice creates a new problem. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving family dysfunction.

**Time:** afternoon  
**Mood:** pharmaceutical numbness  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Dumbo having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in.
