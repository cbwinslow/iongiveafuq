**Time:** 3 AM (why is it always 3 AM?)  
**Mood:** pharmaceutical numbness  

**Action:**  
Rizzo begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations.

**Mood:** gallows humor  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when a misunderstanding escalates out of control. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving systemic inequality.

### Scene 5: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** The Broken Dreams Apartment Complex  
**Time:** afternoon  
**Mood:** dark comedy  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Rizzo having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in. Victory is redefined as "not making things significantly worse," and the audience is reminded that some problems don't get solvedâ€”they just get replaced with new problems.
