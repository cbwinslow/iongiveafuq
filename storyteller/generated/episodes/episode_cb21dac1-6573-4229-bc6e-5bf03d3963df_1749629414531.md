### Scene 1: Rock Bottom Has a Basement

**Location:** 24-Hour Laundromat  
**Time:** afternoon  
**Mood:** resigned cynicism  

**Action:**  
Patty LaHam begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations. The catalyst for today's adventure presents itself in the form of an overdue bill. Despite every instinct screaming "don't get involved," circumstances and poor judgment combine to draw Patty LaHam into the situation.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: lucky charms that aren't working, cellular phones with cracked screens, worn photographs, empty bottles

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Patty LaHam:** "I have a bad feeling about this." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
- **Dumbo:** "Why do I let myself get talked into these things?" *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*


### Scene 2: When Bad Gets Worse

**Location:** Unemployment Office  
**Time:** evening  
**Mood:** existential dread  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when a misunderstanding escalates out of control. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving medical malpractice. Patty LaHam realizes they're in deeper than anticipated and that their usual strategy of "ignore it and hope it goes away" won't work this time.

### Scene 3: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** The Broken Dreams Apartment Complex  
**Time:** late night  
**Mood:** resigned cynicism  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Patty LaHam having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in.
