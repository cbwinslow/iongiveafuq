## Scenes

### Scene 1: Rock Bottom Has a Basement

**Location:** Unemployment Office  
**Time:** early morning  
**Mood:** barely contained rage  

**Action:**  
Dumbo begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations. The catalyst for today's adventure presents itself in the form of an unexpected encounter with someone from their past. Despite every instinct screaming "don't get involved," circumstances and poor judgment combine to draw Dumbo into the situation.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: cellular phones with cracked screens, broken promises, crumpled bills

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Dumbo:** "Look, I didn't ask for this shit to happen..." *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Madame Zelda:** "Things just keep getting worse." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Rizzo:** "Well, that was predictably awful." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*


### Scene 2: When Bad Gets Worse

**Location:** 24-Hour Laundromat  
**Time:** 3 AM (why is it always 3 AM?)  
**Mood:** spite-fueled determination  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when their addiction/vice creates a new problem. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving organized crime. Dumbo realizes they're in deeper than anticipated and that their usual strategy of "ignore it and hope it goes away" won't work this time.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: Harsh fluorescent reality cutting through last night's delusions
- Props: expired coupons, crumpled bills, cellular phones with cracked screens, broken promises

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Dumbo:** "Can we just pretend this is someone else's problem?" *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Rizzo:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
- **Dumbo:** "Can we solve this with minimal effort on my part?" *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Madame Zelda:** "Some lessons are learned the hard way." *(weary sarcasm)*


### Scene 3: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** Sal's Dive Bar  
**Time:** evening  
**Mood:** chemical courage  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Dumbo having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in. Victory is redefined as "not making things significantly worse," and the audience is reminded that some problems don't get solvedâ€”they just get replaced with new problems.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: lucky charms that aren't working, crumpled bills

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Rizzo:** "I've survived worse than whatever's coming." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
- **Dumbo:** "I'm starting to regret leaving the house." *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Madame Zelda:** "Things just keep getting worse." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Dumbo:** "This is getting complicated, and I don't do complicated." *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Rizzo:** "Some stories don't have happy endings, just honest ones." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
