### Scene 1: Rock Bottom Has a Basement

**Location:** Municipal Court  
**Time:** 3 AM (why is it always 3 AM?)  
**Mood:** chemical courage  

**Action:**  
Rizzo begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations. The catalyst for today's adventure presents itself in the form of an overdue bill. Despite every instinct screaming "don't get involved," circumstances and poor judgment combine to draw Rizzo into the situation.

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Scrapz:** "I don't do charity work, and I don't do favors." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Rizzo:** "Things just keep getting worse." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
- **Rizzo:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
- **Dr. Cornelius Needham:** "Some lessons are learned the hard way." *(weary sarcasm)*

**Location:** The Broken Dreams Apartment Complex  
**Time:** afternoon  
**Mood:** pharmaceutical numbness  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when law enforcement becomes involved. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving organized crime. Rizzo realizes they're in deeper than anticipated and that their usual strategy of "ignore it and hope it goes away" won't work this time.

**Time:** 3 AM (why is it always 3 AM?)  
**Mood:** barely contained rage  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Rizzo having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in.
