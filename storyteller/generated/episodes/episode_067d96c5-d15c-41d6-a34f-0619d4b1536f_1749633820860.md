## Scenes

### Scene 1: Rock Bottom Has a Basement

**Location:** The Roach Motel  
**Time:** 3 AM (why is it always 3 AM?)  
**Mood:** resigned cynicism  

**Action:**  
Scrapz begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations. The catalyst for today's adventure presents itself in the form of a knock at the door. Despite every instinct screaming "don't get involved," circumstances and poor judgment combine to draw Scrapz into the situation.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: Where dignity comes to die and rent checks bounce higher than expectations
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: crumpled bills, lucky charms that aren't working, cellular phones with cracked screens

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Scrapz:** "I don't do charity work, and I don't do favors." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "Why does this always happen?" *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Dumbo:** "Can we solve this with minimal effort on my part?" *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Scrapz:** "I've seen this shit before, it doesn't end well." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "At least it's over." *(weary sarcasm)*


### Scene 2: When Bad Gets Worse

**Location:** Madame Zelda's Fortune Telling Parlor  
**Time:** late night  
**Mood:** gallows humor  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when someone they trusted betrays them. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving their own psychological damage. Scrapz realizes they're in deeper than anticipated and that their usual strategy of "ignore it and hope it goes away" won't work this time.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A dimly lit establishment where hope goes to die and problems get temporarily drowned
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: lucky charms that aren't working, broken promises, prescription bottles

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Scrapz:** "I don't do charity work, and I don't do favors." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Officer Stan Kowalski:** "Why does this always happen?" *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Officer Stan Kowalski:** "Some lessons are learned the hard way." *(weary sarcasm)*


### Scene 3: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** Unemployment Office  
**Time:** afternoon  
**Mood:** dark comedy  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Scrapz having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in. Victory is redefined as "not making things significantly worse," and the audience is reminded that some problems don't get solvedâ€”they just get replaced with new problems.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: Golden hour irony - beauty highlighting ugliness
- Props: lucky charms that aren't working, expired coupons, worn photographs

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Officer Stan Kowalski:** "I have a bad feeling about this." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Officer Stan Kowalski:** "Why does this always happen?" *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Dumbo:** "This is getting complicated, and I don't do complicated." *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Dumbo:** "This is getting complicated, and I don't do complicated." *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Scrapz:** "I told you this was a bad idea." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*


## Moral of the Story
Life's a bitch, and then you die. But first, you pay taxes.
