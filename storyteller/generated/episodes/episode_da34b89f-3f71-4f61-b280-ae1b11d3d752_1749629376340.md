## Scenes

### Scene 1: Rock Bottom Has a Basement

**Location:** Lucky's Liquor Store  
**Time:** 3 AM (why is it always 3 AM?)  
**Mood:** dark comedy  

**Action:**  
Rizzo begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations. The catalyst for today's adventure presents itself in the form of a minor emergency that requires leaving their comfort zone. Despite every instinct screaming "don't get involved," circumstances and poor judgment combine to draw Rizzo into the situation.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: crumpled bills, lucky charms that aren't working

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Scrapz:** "What's in it for me? And don't say 'satisfaction.'" *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Scrapz:** "I've seen this shit before, it doesn't end well." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(weary sarcasm)*

A conversation with Karen the Social Worker reveals new information that changes Rizzo's understanding of the situation.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: Neon desperation casting rainbow shadows on concrete dreams
- Props: lottery tickets, worn photographs, cellular phones with cracked screens

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Rizzo:** "Let me guess, someone needs the expert on suffering." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "Things just keep getting worse." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Rizzo:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "Why does this always happen?" *(weary sarcasm)*

### Scene 3: When Bad Gets Worse

**Location:** Sal's Dive Bar  
**Time:** late morning  
**Mood:** desperately optimistic  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when their addiction/vice creates a new problem. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving corporate greed. Rizzo realizes they're in deeper than anticipated and that their usual strategy of "ignore it and hope it goes away" won't work this time.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A dimly lit establishment where hope goes to die and problems get temporarily drowned
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: cellular phones with cracked screens, empty bottles

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Mama Rosetti:** "Well, this should be interesting." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Mama Rosetti:** "Why does this always happen?" *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Rizzo:** "Well, that was predictably awful." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*


### Scene 4: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** The Broken Dreams Apartment Complex  
**Time:** early morning  
**Mood:** gallows humor  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Rizzo having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in. Victory is redefined as "not making things significantly worse," and the audience is reminded that some problems don't get solvedâ€”they just get replaced with new problems.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A dimly lit establishment where hope goes to die and problems get temporarily drowned
- Lighting: Harsh fluorescent reality cutting through last night's delusions
- Props: empty bottles, cellular phones with cracked screens, expired coupons, prescription bottles

- **Rizzo:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "Why does this always happen?" *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Mama Rosetti:** "At least it's over." *(weary sarcasm)*
