**Action:**  
Scrapz begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations.

**Location:** Dr. Needham's Underground Lab  
**Time:** late morning  
**Mood:** gallows humor  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when their reputation precedes them. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving government bureaucracy.

**Time:** evening  
**Mood:** chemical courage

The episode concludes with Scrapz having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in.
