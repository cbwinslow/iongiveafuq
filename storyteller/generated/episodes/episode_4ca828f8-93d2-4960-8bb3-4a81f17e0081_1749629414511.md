## Scenes

### Scene 1: Rock Bottom Has a Basement

**Location:** Dr. Needham's Underground Lab  
**Time:** early morning  
**Mood:** desperately optimistic  

**Action:**  
Scrapz begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations. The catalyst for today's adventure presents itself in the form of an unexpected encounter with someone from their past. Despite every instinct screaming "don't get involved," circumstances and poor judgment combine to draw Scrapz into the situation.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: Neon desperation casting rainbow shadows on concrete dreams
- Props: prescription bottles, empty bottles, lottery tickets, expired coupons

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "Well, this should be interesting." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
- **Scrapz:** "Trust me, it gets worse from here." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "Things just keep getting worse." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "That went about as well as expected." *(weary sarcasm)*


### Scene 2: When Bad Gets Worse

**Location:** Pawn Shop Paradise  
**Time:** late morning  
**Mood:** dark comedy  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when their reputation precedes them. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving neighborhood politics. Scrapz realizes they're in deeper than anticipated and that their usual strategy of "ignore it and hope it goes away" won't work this time.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: expired coupons, cellular phones with cracked screens, worn photographs

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Scrapz:** "Let me guess, you need someone else to clean up your mess." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "Why does this always happen?" *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "At least it's over." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*


### Scene 3: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** The Broken Dreams Apartment Complex  
**Time:** noon  
**Mood:** gallows humor  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Scrapz having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in. Victory is redefined as "not making things significantly worse," and the audience is reminded that some problems don't get solvedâ€”they just get replaced with new problems.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: Unforgiving daylight exposing every flaw and failure
- Props: empty bottles, crumpled bills

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "I have a bad feeling about this." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Scrapz:** "I've seen this shit before, it doesn't end well." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Scrapz:** "Trust me, it gets worse from here." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "At least it's over." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
