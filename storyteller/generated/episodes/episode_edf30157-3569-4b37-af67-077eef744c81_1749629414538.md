**Location:** Municipal Court  
**Time:** late night  
**Mood:** desperately optimistic  

**Action:**

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Karen the Social Worker:** "Well, this should be interesting." *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Rizzo:** "Why does this always happen?" *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*

**Mood:** existential dread  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when their simple plan attracts unwanted attention. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving corporate greed.

### Scene 5: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** The Alley Behind Everything  
**Time:** early morning  
**Mood:** spite-fueled determination  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Rizzo having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in. Victory is redefined as "not making things significantly worse," and the audience is reminded that some problems don't get solvedâ€”they just get replaced with new problems.
