The situation escalates when their addiction/vice creates a new problem. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving medical malpractice.

The episode concludes with Scrapz having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in.
