## Scenes

### Scene 1: Rock Bottom Has a Basement

**Location:** Municipal Court  
**Time:** evening  
**Mood:** gallows humor  

**Action:**  
Buzz begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations. The catalyst for today's adventure presents itself in the form of running out of their vice of choice. Despite every instinct screaming "don't get involved," circumstances and poor judgment combine to draw Buzz into the situation.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: Harsh fluorescent reality cutting through last night's delusions
- Props: overdue notices, prescription bottles, worn photographs

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Buzz:** "I'm too drunk for this, but not drunk enough." *(slurred optimism fighting against bitter reality)*
- **Dumbo:** "Can we solve this with minimal effort on my part?" *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*
- **Scrapz:** "Trust me, it gets worse from here." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Buzz:** "I'm gonna need something stronger than beer." *(slurred optimism fighting against bitter reality)*


### Scene 2: When Bad Gets Worse

**Location:** Pawn Shop Paradise  
**Time:** late night  
**Mood:** gallows humor  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when a misunderstanding escalates out of control. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving their own psychological damage. Buzz realizes they're in deeper than anticipated and that their usual strategy of "ignore it and hope it goes away" won't work this time.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: Where dignity comes to die and rent checks bounce higher than expectations
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: broken promises, empty bottles, expired coupons, overdue notices

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Buzz:** "Why do all my problems start with someone saying my name?" *(slurred optimism fighting against bitter reality)*
- **Dumbo:** "I'm starting to regret leaving the house." *(defeated resignation with occasional flashes of frustrated energy)*

### Scene 3: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** The Plasma Donation Center  
**Time:** late morning  
**Mood:** existential dread  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Buzz having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in. Victory is redefined as "not making things significantly worse," and the audience is reminded that some problems don't get solvedâ€”they just get replaced with new problems.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
