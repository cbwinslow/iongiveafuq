## Scenes

### Scene 1: Rock Bottom Has a Basement

**Location:** Dr. Needham's Underground Lab  
**Time:** afternoon  
**Mood:** desperately optimistic  

**Action:**  
Patty LaHam begins their day with the usual routine of avoiding responsibility and managing expectations. The catalyst for today's adventure presents itself in the form of a phone call they can't ignore. Despite every instinct screaming "don't get involved," circumstances and poor judgment combine to draw Patty LaHam into the situation.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: Harsh fluorescent reality cutting through last night's delusions
- Props: overdue notices, cellular phones with cracked screens, crumpled bills

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Scrapz:** "What's in it for me? And don't say 'satisfaction.'" *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Scrapz:** "Everyone's got an angle, what's yours?" *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "This is not what I signed up for." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
- **Sal the Bartender:** "At least it's over." *(weary sarcasm)*


### Scene 2: When Bad Gets Worse

**Location:** The Plasma Donation Center  
**Time:** late morning  
**Mood:** pharmaceutical numbness  

**Action:**  
The situation escalates when someone they trusted betrays them. What seemed like a manageable problem reveals itself to be connected to larger issues involving family dysfunction. Patty LaHam realizes they're in deeper than anticipated and that their usual strategy of "ignore it and hope it goes away" won't work this time.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A dimly lit establishment where hope goes to die and problems get temporarily drowned
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: lottery tickets, cellular phones with cracked screens, broken promises

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Rizzo:** "Let me guess, someone needs the expert on suffering." *(dark humor as a defense mechanism against trauma)*
- **Scrapz:** "Trust me, it gets worse from here." *(sharp cynicism barely masking deeper hurt)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "At least it's over." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*


### Scene 3: Same Shit, Different Day

**Location:** Municipal Court  
**Time:** late morning  
**Mood:** barely contained rage  

**Action:**  
The episode concludes with Patty LaHam having learned nothing from their experience but somehow finding themselves in a slightly different variation of the same situation they started in. Victory is redefined as "not making things significantly worse," and the audience is reminded that some problems don't get solvedâ€”they just get replaced with new problems.

**Visual Details:**  
- Setting: A place where life happens to people who've stopped trying to control it
- Lighting: The kind of lighting that makes everyone look like they've made poor life choices
- Props: expired coupons, worn photographs

**Key Dialogue:**
- **Mickey the Dealer:** "Why do I always get involved in these situations?" *(weary sarcasm)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "Things just keep getting worse." *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
- **Patty LaHam:** "Why does this always happen?" *(theatrical drama covering genuine vulnerability)*
- **Mickey the Dealer:** "At least it's over." *(weary sarcasm)*


## Moral of the Story
There's always another level of failure waiting to be discovered.
