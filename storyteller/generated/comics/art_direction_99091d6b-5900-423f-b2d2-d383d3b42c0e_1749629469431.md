# Art Direction: Addiction and Other Hobbies

## Overall Vision
Create a three_panel comic strip that captures the dark humor and authentic cynicism of Buzz's worldview. The visual style should reinforce the theme of "Rock bottom isn't the bottom" while maintaining the authentic urban decay aesthetic of the iongiveafuq universe.

## Character Design
**Primary Character: Buzz**
- cross-eyed, swaying stance, permanent five o'clock shadow
- Signature items: beer bottle collection, stained tank top, flip-flops
- Setting context: dive bars, liquor stores, park benches, AA meetings
- Personality reflected in design: friendly drunk, clumsy, oversharing, optimistically delusional

## Visual Style Guidelines
- **Art Style:** gritty urban realism
- **Color Approach:** cyberpunk neon on dark backgrounds
- **Typography:** mixed digital and hand-drawn text
- **Background Treatment:** selective focus with blurred backgrounds

## Character Consistency Notes
- **character models:** Maintain consistent character proportions and features across panels
- **expressions:** Exaggerate facial expressions for comic effect while staying true to character
- **clothing:** Keep signature clothing items and accessories consistent
- **body language:** Reflect character personalities through posture and gestures
- **environmental consistency:** Maintain lighting and perspective consistency within scenes
