# Art Direction: Dumbo's Daily Dose of Reality

## Overall Vision
Create a three_panel comic strip that captures the dark humor and authentic cynicism of Dumbo's worldview. The visual style should reinforce the theme of "Rock bottom isn't the bottom" while maintaining the authentic urban decay aesthetic of the iongiveafuq universe.

## Character Design
**Primary Character: Dumbo**
- droopy, bloodshot
- Signature items: crusty pizza slice, stained remote control, empty beer cans
- Setting context: cluttered sofa with pizza boxes, soda cans, snack wrappers
- Personality reflected in design: goofy, carefree, oblivious, slothful

## Visual Style Guidelines
- **Art Style:** indie comic style
- **Color Approach:** noir-inspired shadows with selective color
- **Typography:** hand-lettered dialogue with rough edges
- **Background Treatment:** selective focus with blurred backgrounds

## Character Consistency Notes
- **character models:** Maintain consistent character proportions and features across panels
- **expressions:** Exaggerate facial expressions for comic effect while staying true to character
- **clothing:** Keep signature clothing items and accessories consistent
- **body language:** Reflect character personalities through posture and gestures
- **environmental consistency:** Maintain lighting and perspective consistency within scenes

## Panel-by-Panel Art Direction

### Panel 1
- **Composition:** wide establishing shot
- **Visual Focus:** character expression and body language
- **Mood:** gallows humor
- **Key Elements:** Opening panel establishing Dumbo in their typical environment: cluttered sofa with pizza boxes, soda cans, snack wrappers. The scene shows Dumbo wakes up to face another day of problems they didn't create. Dumbo displays their characteristic goofy demeanor.
- **Dialogue Placement:** "I was having a perfectly mediocre day until..." (thought_bubble)

### Panel 2
- **Composition:** close-up for emphasis
- **Visual Focus:** environmental details that reinforce mood
- **Mood:** weary acceptance
- **Key Elements:** Dumbo provides commentary on the absurdity of their situation
- **Dialogue Placement:** "I'm too sober for this conversation." (standard_speech)

### Panel 3
- **Composition:** zoom out for perspective
- **Visual Focus:** facial close-up for emotional impact
- **Mood:** chemical numbness
- **Key Elements:** Final panel delivering the punchline: At least failure is predictable.. Dumbo's expression perfectly captures their chronically unemployed nature as they deliver their trademark cynical wisdom.
- **Dialogue Placement:** "At least failure is consistent." (standard_speech)
