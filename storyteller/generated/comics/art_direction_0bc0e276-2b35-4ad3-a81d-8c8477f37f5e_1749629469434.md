# Art Direction: Relationship Status: It's Complicated (And Doomed)

## Overall Vision
Create a six_panel comic strip that captures the dark humor and authentic cynicism of Rizzo's worldview. The visual style should reinforce the theme of "False hope is the cruelest hope" while maintaining the authentic urban decay aesthetic of the iongiveafuq universe.

- Signature items: poison bottle, death certificate collection, tiny coffin
- Setting context: sewers, morgues, abandoned hospitals, graveyards
- Personality reflected in design: morbidly humorous, unlucky, sarcastic, fatalistic
