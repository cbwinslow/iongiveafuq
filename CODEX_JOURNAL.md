## CODEX JOURNAL - 2025-06-16 01:26 UTC
Initial thoughts: Starting new storyline docs for mascots in Japanese manga style. Plan to create docs for each character with backgrounds, habits, traits, etc., plus a cross-character storyline doc. Will log changes in DIFF and suggestions in RECOMMENDATIONS.

### 01:30 UTC
Created docs/characters and docs/storylines directories. Added extended backstories for Scrapz, Dumbo, Patty LaHam, Buzz, and Rizzo in manga style. Also wrote Mascot_Storylines.md with five short episodes, each pairing characters. Logged DIFF and RECOMMENDATIONS files with timestamped names.

### 01:35 UTC
Attempted `npm run build` in frontend after installing packages. Build failed due to missing `index.html`. Documenting as expected given minimal project state.
