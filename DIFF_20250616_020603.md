+# Storyline and Feature Expansion Plan
+
+## Story Arc Suggestions
+1. **Mascots Unite:** Introduce a mini-comic series where the mascots band together to reclaim the last remaining "fuqs, shits, and damns" from a rival corporation.
+2. **Origins Episodes:** Short blog posts or animated clips exploring how each mascot lost their "fuqs" or "shits" in a humorous backstory.
+3. **Interactive Store Tour:** A storyline-driven walkthrough of the website guided by the mascots, revealing hidden jokes and Easter eggs.
+4. **Community Challenges:** Users submit their own "no fuqs given" moments. Best entries get featured with custom art.
+5. **Special Guest Mascots:** Seasonal cameos from new characters (e.g., a cynical turkey for Thanksgiving) to keep content fresh.
+
+## Improvement Ideas
+- **Art Upgrades:** Commission high-quality neon-themed artwork for each mascot to match the cyberpunk aesthetic.
+- **Animated Intros:** Use Framer Motion or Lottie to create short entrance animations when each page loads.
+- **Expanded Merch:** Beyond the novelty items, consider digital goods like wallpapers or emoji packs themed around each mascot.
+- **Lore Page:** Add a dedicated page explaining the world where people can literally purchase "fuqs" and "shits".
+- **Mini-Games:** Simple browser games (e.g., catching falling "fuqs") tied into the storyline to boost engagement.
