Created CHANGES.md, DIFF_2025-06-16_02-25-54.md, and RECOMMENDATIONS_2025-06-16_02-25-54.md for documenting changes and recommendations.
- Ran `npm ci` in both frontend and backend directories to install dependencies.
- Attempted `npm run build` in frontend but it failed because `index.html` is missing at project root.
- Verified backend server starts after installing dependencies.
- Created CHANGES.md summarizing required pages and comparison to similar sites.
- Added recommendations in RECOMMENDATIONS_2025-06-16_02-25-54.md.
- Added .gitignore to exclude node_modules and logs.
