- [ ] Maintain a dedicated lore page describing the dystopian world where currencies are replaced with "fuqs," "shits," and "damns." This helps unify the storyline.
- [ ] Integrate small interactive elements (hover animations, sound effects) for each mascot to make the site feel lively.
- [ ] Plan for an email newsletter where mascots share comedic updates and limited-time digital content.
